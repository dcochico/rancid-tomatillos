## WINS, CHALLENGES & REFLECTIONS 
# Wins
- Implementing a dynamic nav-bar was super fun, and we're happy with how it turned out.
- Embedding YouTube videos into our Focus pages was very satisfying to accomplish.
- Creating a custom 404 error page was also a neat ticket.
# Challenges
- Cypress tended to be buggy, so we would sometimes question whether our tests were failing due to faulty code or not.
- Additionally, it could get frustrating sometimes when we would implement new features, and completely break our entire Cypress testing suite. We experienced just how sensitive Cypress can be.
# Reflections
- Overall, this was such a fun project! React makes our lives a bit easier over plain old vanilla Javascript, and we are excited to build upon our project with more extensions in the future.
